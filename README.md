This project implements several well known statistical methods used to perform inductive analysis on sample data

*work in progress*

## Contents
- Linear Models (such as Linear Regression, Ridge Regression etc.)
- Decomposition (Principal Component Analysis)
- Neural Networks (later)

## Installation

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/ "python-poetry.org") as its dependency manager.
If you do not already have it, install Poetry.
For instructions, follow this link:

https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/blob/master/README.md#installation


Once you have Poetry installed, clone the repository and execute:
